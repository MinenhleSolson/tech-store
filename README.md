## Summary

This is the Ecommerce store where a user can buy items and Add them to cart I built it using React.js, material ui and hosted using firebase,
I really enjoyed creating this project what became a challenge for was how a my going to make the cart refresh when I click "Add to cart" button
I knew Redux was perfect for this situation but I needed something Light weight so I ended up using the React Context API.
